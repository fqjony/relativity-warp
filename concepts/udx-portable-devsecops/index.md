# UDX: Portable DevSecOps Framework

<img width="1642" height="924" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d525e92-8dd7-43fd-aa98-c74a35c4e518" />

## 🚀 Overview
UDX is a containerized ecosystem that solves the AI "execution gap" by providing models with standardized "hands" (Docker Workers) and "memory" (Context7). It decouples abstract reasoning from infrastructure action, ensuring that every command is grounded in 12-factor best practices and executed in a secure, identical environment across any IDE.

## 🏗️ System Components

### 1. MCP (The Interface & Orchestrator)
The **Model Context Protocol** serves as the standardized communication bus (JSON-RPC) between the AI brain and your local/cloud tools. It acts as both a host for real-time data fetching and a builder for specialized, portable worker environments.

### 2. Context7 (The Grounding Layer)
The "Environmental Memory" containing proprietary blueprints for HA/DR, WordPress optimization, and 12-factor standards. It physically injects high-fidelity experience snippets into the LLM's prompt, preventing hallucinations and ensuring suggestions match your specific architecture.

### 3. UDX Extension (Sensory & Acquisition)
The primary UI and sensory input that monitors Git events, terminal errors, and TDD progress. It proactively surfaces advice and SVG diagrams while serving as a growth funnel via "Open in UDX" web-to-IDE buttons.

### 4. AI Normalization (The Intent Firewall)
A translation layer that converts raw human prompts into schema-validated technical intents. It enforces security headers and compliance rules before any command reaches the execution phase.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Standardized Docker Execution:** Hardened, identical worker containers ensure "it works on my machine" security and reliability for every AI action.
* **Knowledge-Grounded Reasoning:** Direct injection of Context7 expertise ensures AI advice follows senior engineering standards by default.
* **Proactive Guardrails:** Background monitoring of local workflows to suggest Git hygiene, TDD patterns, and architecture improvements.
* **Visual Logic Mapping:** Automated SVG diagram generation to make complex infrastructure plans transparent and auditable.
* **Instant Portability:** Spin up secure automation workers on any machine via a single CLI command or a web-link click.

## 💰 Monetization
* **Access Model:** Usage of basic features is free; access to advanced DevSecOps workers, premium architectural guidance, and specific automation tools requires a **UDX API Key (Subscription)**.

## 🛠️ Roadmap & Critical TODOs

1.  **Documentation Sync:** Update all worker docs to be dual-friendly (Human/Robot) and integrate Context7 prompts across all technical guides.
2.  **Data Validation:** Test and fix Context7 sync logic to ensure data fits both "component" and "standalone MCP" use cases.
3.  **Lingua Franca:** Determine the optimal standard/language for defining LLM mappings and rules to maximize effectivity.
4.  **Context Awareness:** Refine logic for accurately capturing workspace-level, project-level, and global context.
5.  **Permission Strategy:** Establish a balanced permission model that ensures security without creating friction or user distrust.
